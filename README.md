## Use this custom image

- Edit the configuration file with the command: `abroot config-editor`.
- Change the "name" entry from something like `vanilla-os/desktop` to `bigc0127/linuxpatriot1776-custom`.  [**Note**: All characters must be in lowercase.]
- Now, Run `abroot upgrade` to switch to my custom image.

## Extra steps to make Mullvad VPN work

- Download the most recent version of mullvad vpn from their website. (you can use the binary download or you can add the repo, both work but i recommend using the repo as if there is a update this makes it seemless for you)
- Install mullvad
- once it is installed it should automatically export the GUI app into the app drawer (like proton VPN did without all these extra steps)
- profit! (you are now free to use mullvad.

## Suggestions
- if you want to request a new VPN or have suggestions on how to get windscribe to build on this image please let me know.. via a issue report or hmu on discord @linuxpatriot1776
